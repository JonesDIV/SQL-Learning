## Introduction

This repository contains SQL code snippets, solutions, and notes from my learning journey. By solving these problems, I aim to deepen my understanding of SQL concepts, including querying, data manipulation, and database design.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `SQL_Murder_Mystery/`: Solutions and queries related to the SQL Murder Mystery challenge.
- `LeetCode/`: SQL problems and solutions sourced from LeetCode.
- `Others/`: SQL examples and exercises from various other sources.

Each directory contains relevant SQL files and may include README files with additional context or explanations.

## Sources

The main sources of the SQL exercises and examples in this repository include:

1. **SQL Murder Mystery**: A fun and interactive way to practice SQL by solving a murder mystery using SQL queries. [More about SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/)
2. **LeetCode**: A platform offering a wide range of coding challenges, including SQL problems. [LeetCode SQL Problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/)

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-learning.git
